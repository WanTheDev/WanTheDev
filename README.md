# Hi, I'm Wan.

I started game development in 2018 and got into web development in around 2022.
<br>
Currently, I'm pursuing to be a full-stack developer.

|      GML     | 2018 - Current<br><br>Very proefficient | My love for games made me really want to make my own,<br>thus I bought a license for GMS2.0 in late 2018 and<br>started learning by trial and error and various tutorials.                                                                                             |
|    Node.js   |      2020 - Current<br><br>Mediocre     | I asked a friend how would I approach making a multiplayer game,<br>and he recommended node.js, so I learned node.js *before* javascript,<br>I did drop it after a while, only recently coming back to it for web backend                                              |
|      C++     |           2022<br><br>Beginner          | I'm not really sure why I learned C++, I heard it's powerful and I wanted<br>to see what the hype was about, I dropped it after a while and switched to<br>learning javascript, I still know the basics, but not really good at it.                                    |
|   HTML/CSS   |   2021 - Current<br><br>Intermiediate   | I started learning HTML/CSS in early 2021, I really hated it since it wasn't the<br>"usual" language, which made me hate web development and I thought it wasn't for me, <br>but I came back to it when I started learning javascript and found it easy after a while. |
| Javascript   |    2022 - Current<br><br>Proefficient   | Javascript is really similar to GML, so I had a really easy time picking it up,<br>and became proefficient in it very quickly, as of today, it's my second favourite<br>language to use, right after GML.                                                              |
|   React.js   |        2023 - Current<br><br>Good       | React was really easy to pick up, I already was using a similar component concept in my<br>web development, so react just made it a whole lot easier by having components<br>be functions and hooks providing so much more utility.                                    |
|    Emotion   |        2023 - Current<br><br>Good       | The only reason I got into emotion is due to mantine, it's a component library that<br>uses emotion, and I really like how these 2 work together, so in pretty much all of my<br>projects I use them in unison.                                                        |
